# Straight Talk for Government 
A virtual chapter of the DevOps Institute

### **The Straight Talk effort strives to create lasting change through a self-sustaining community.** 

## Observations and Opportunity
The Straight Talk for Government concept is based on the last few years of observations, study, and work with DOD, Civilian, US States, and our partner nations.   In some areas, the Government is falling farther and farther behind in the ability to deliver business and mission value in the form of stable and secure software and software intensive systems There are myriad tactical training and commercial “unicorn”  success stories.  The problem is that the government lacks relevant examples of software modernization, digital transformation, and DevSecOps/DevOps or DataOps at scale.  
 
DevSecOps and software architecture is predicated on continuously addressing changing needs of people, process, technology and culture.  Without a constant communal sharing of success and failure stories, the government continues to overly focus on the most tactical aspects of software delivery: training developers to “code fast” and giving them automation tools. Without institutional experience sharing and community, the government will continue to micro-focus on tools and not on value delivery or scalable and sustainable transformation.

## The Needs
### 1 - Relevant Objective Guidance
Government is adamantly seeking real and lasting change and is not armed or able without help.  To that end, the government is more frequently turning to industry and commercial organizations for guidance.   Working directly with for-profit  system integrators, contractors, and software vendors, the government has started to seek expert guidance and tactical action plans for broad sets of software architecture and engineering topics especially DevOps/DevSecOps, AIOps, DataOps, and Software Modernization. The challenge is balancing objectivity with subjective/for-profit guidance. Government to government connections also need to be proliferated sharing both successes and challenges.
 
### 2- Cohesive taxonomy and approaches
Industry also needs help in reaching out to the government and to understand the unique challenges and to collaboratively address the challenges. Government and industry do not have a common lexicon causing even greater confusions and often a focus on “buying the next tool” over understanding the opportunities and challenges inherent with the US Federal government . To bolster objectivity, MITRE and other FFRDC's like SEI are chartering this effort to facilitate balanced cross pollination.
 
### 3 - Meeting People Where They are
The demographics of the government workers are changing. The workforce is now a mix of digital natives (millennials) and digital pioneers ( Gen X and Baby Boomers).   The use of social media, asynchronous connections, community involvement, and information consumption needs to be relevant, meaningful, and sincere.  Our approach is to elevate the expertise we have and broadcast our conversations, experience, and guidance in public view so that we can drive the objective narrative alongside Industry. This effort is publicly relevant through a social media campaign targeted at DevOps/DevSecOps leaders in government as well as establishing the first virtual chapter of the DevOps Institute to bring together experts from across the nation.
 
## The Vision
The vision is to establish a sustainable and engaging cross-governmental community that will provide the forum(s) for sharing success and failure experiences.  By connecting these individuals, we will enable more meaningful cross talk, learning, growth, and increased success throughout the government sector.  Coupled with the establishment of a shared body of knowledge and continuous influx of relevant, curated information, Government, Industry, Academia, and FFRDCs will work more closely and at the speed of relevance. 
 
We are also dedicated to providing a psychologically safe place for all that is focused on helping the government but is not chartered or driven by any government agency: for government, with government, by all.
